# JavaRPG

This is a small 2D choice-based RPG I built when I was first learning Java.

The goal was to experiment with object-oriented design, basic UI, and game flow control. While the structure and code quality reflect my early learning phase, the project helped me understand class relationships, game logic, and file I/O in Java.
